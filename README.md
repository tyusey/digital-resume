Digital Resume for Capstone Design Class

# I am a senior studying electrical engineering at Mississippi State University. Right now, I am planning on pursuing postgraduate education, where I hope to research how wide-bandgap semiconductors can be used to improve power electronic devices. I have research experience in power electronics design and analysis, as well as optoelectronic materials research experience. I have also spent a semester in Washington, D.C. representing the Bagley College of Engineering as an intern in the U.S. Senate. Feel free to reach out to me at tgu5@msstate.edu after looking at this resume if you have any questions about my experience.
